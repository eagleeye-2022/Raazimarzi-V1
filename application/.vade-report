Implemented Vercel Speed Insights for React

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights in the React application.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` (v1.3.1) using npm
- Package added to dependencies in package.json

### 2. Modified Files

**src/App.jsx**
- Added import statement: `import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/react";`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the Router component, after the UserProvider and CaseProvider wrappers
- Preserved all existing code structure and functionality
- Maintained consistent code style with existing emoji comments (🟢)

**package.json**
- Added `@vercel/speed-insights": "^1.3.1"` to dependencies

**package-lock.json**
- Updated with new dependency tree for @vercel/speed-insights and its dependencies

## Implementation Details:

The SpeedInsights component was placed at the root level of the Router component to ensure it monitors all route changes and page performance metrics throughout the application. This placement allows it to:
- Track Core Web Vitals across all pages
- Monitor performance metrics for all user interactions
- Collect data for all routes (user, admin, mediator, case manager dashboards and pages)

## Verification:

✅ Build completed successfully (npm run build)
✅ No new ESLint errors introduced
✅ All existing warnings remain (unrelated to our changes)
✅ Package manager lockfiles updated correctly

The application is now configured to send performance metrics to Vercel Speed Insights when deployed on Vercel.
